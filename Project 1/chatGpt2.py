import random  # ?  Import the random module for generating the computer's choices

# * Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
# * This program allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
# * The user enters how many rounds they want to play.
# * In each round, the user chooses 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors.
# * The computer randomly chooses a move.
# * The winner is decided based on the classic game rules.
# * At the end, the program shows the total number of wins, losses, and ties.
